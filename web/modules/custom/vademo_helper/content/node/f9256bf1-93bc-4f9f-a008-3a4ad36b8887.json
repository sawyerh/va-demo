The Privacy Act Statement will contain any additional privacy policies that apply to the information collected on a particular VA Web page. The Web pages that collect personal information will have a hyperlink to the Limited Privacy Policy that applies to that particular Web page.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will use your information to process requests for services or information. When VA collects information from you, we will reference the relevant authority in the appropriate Limited Privacy Policy. Providing the information is generally voluntary, but if it is not provided, we may not be able to execute a required action. When information is required to process your request, we will advise you of this fact in the appropriate Limited Privacy Policy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>VA follows the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552a), which requires VA to protect your personal information that VA maintains in Systems of Records. The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-503), amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding certain protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automated Matching Programs. Notices of Systems of Records and Matching Programs must be published in the Federal Register at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/\">www.federalregister.gov<\/a>&nbsp;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A System of Records is a file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier. The Privacy Act provides a number of protections for your personal information. These typically include how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and disposed. Our System of Record Notices with links to the Federal Register are available at: :&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/systems_of_records.aspx\">https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/systems_of_records.aspx<\/a>&nbsp;. The Systems of Records that claim certain exemptions from the Privacy Act are identified in the Federal Register and are available at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1\/pdf\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1-sec1-582.pdf\">https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1\/pdf\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1-sec1-582.pdf<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) is an assessment of how information in identifiable form is collected, stored, protected, shared, and managed. The purpose of a PIA is to demonstrate that system owners and developers have incorporated privacy protections throughout the entire life cycle of a system.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nA listing of VA PIAs is available at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/pia.aspx\">https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/pia.aspx<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Computer Matching Programs allow matching of data from two or more information systems in order to detect or prevent fraud, waste and abuse in government programs.

Providing the information is generally voluntary, but if it is not provided, we may not be able to execute a required action. When information is required to process your request, we will advise you of this fact in the appropriate Limited Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>VA follows the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552a), which requires VA to protect your personal information that VA maintains in Systems of Records. The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-503), amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding certain protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automated Matching Programs. Notices of Systems of Records and Matching Programs must be published in the Federal Register at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/\">www.federalregister.gov<\/a>\u00a0.<\/p>\n<p>A System of Records is a file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier. The Privacy Act provides a number of protections for your personal information. These typically include how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and disposed. Our System of Record Notices with links to the Federal Register are available at: :\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/systems_of_records.aspx\">https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/systems_of_records.aspx<\/a>\u00a0. The Systems of Records that claim certain exemptions from the Privacy Act are identified in the Federal Register and are available at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1\/pdf\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1-sec1-582.pdf\">https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1\/pdf\/CFR-2016-title38-vol1-sec1-582.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) is an assessment of how information in identifiable form is collected, stored, protected, shared, and managed. The purpose of a PIA is to demonstrate that system owners and developers have incorporated privacy protections throughout the entire life cycle of a system.\u00a0<br \/>\nA listing of VA PIAs is available at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/pia.aspx\">https:\/\/www.oprm.va.gov\/privacy\/pia.aspx<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Computer Matching Programs allow matching of data from two or more information systems in order to detect or prevent fraud, waste and abuse in government programs.

We also use such statistics to tell us of any possible site performance problems.\u00a0 Except for oversight, law enforcement investigations, or protection of the VA information technology

remember information about your previous visits and use of the Web site.\u00a0 Persistent cookies are generally not used by VA or other Federal government Web sites, unless there is a compelling and authorized reason for their use. \u00a0If any VA Web page uses a Persistent Cookie, then the\u00a0Limited Privacy Policy\u00a0for that Web page will clearly state the purpose and legal authority for such use.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>We use Session Cookies in the following manner:<\/h3>\n<p>Log-on and log-off process \u2014 you do not have to log-on and register to browse our site.\u00a0 If you decide to

refer to the instructions for your particular Internet browser software to determine how to examine the security certificate from our Web site to verify the security of the connection.<\/p>\n<p>For
